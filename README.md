# D2L-Learning
This repository is to record anything meaningful and useful for me during the study of d2l course.
This course include two version Eng and Chinese versions. It contains lost of interesting and cool contents about machine learning and DeepLearning as well. During the journey of getting more and more proficient about ML and DL, I should understand and do a lot of tries about the code in this course, so I make a record here which will give me the opportunity to look back.
and the course website(Eng version)is [D2L](https://d2l.ai/index.html)
